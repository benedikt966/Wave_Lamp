# Wave_Lamp

I saw this awesome lamp on thingiverse [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3481557) and thougt, that i need a sort of this lamp in my room. The only problem: I only have a 12*12*12cm printing volume with my MPSM 2. So I printed the lamp with a high of just 61% and the LED Bar with a high of 11.5cm. 
Most of the parts were printe with transparent PLA, only the bottom of the body was printed with grey Filament. 

## print

The print worked awesome, I was surprised by the spiral mode, which worked perfectly and created thin walls all over the lamp cover. I had some problems with the bed adhesion like always, but I could perfectly work with the results. 

## Installation

As a controller I use the ESP32 with the WiFi module and the code section is in /https:...

As a lightstrip I use WS2812 and instead of just wrapping it once around the tower, I wrapped it twice around the middle circle. 


## Control with Phone

Is planned 

## code

```c++
pip install foobar
```
